# Static Hosting Options, Compared

So you've built the perfect static site, and it's time to launch. Where will you deploy your code? Below, I host this specific site on different options and compare.

## Table of Contents

1. GitHub Pages
2. Netlify
3. Surge
4. AWS
5. Conclusions
6. More to Come

## 1. GitHub Pages

An obvious choice, the site source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/delster/delster-portfolio) already. This will be the compiled version of the repo, served from GitHub Pages.

## 2. Netlify

The site's currently hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)'s incredible free plan.

## 3. Surge

[Surge](https://surge.sh/) is probably the fastest possible way to deplay a static site. Once you get it set up, you can simply terminal `surge` from the project root. An obvious contender.

## 4. AWS

Okay, so this isn't quite the same animal, but I'm going to upload the site to an S3 bucket and see what happens.

## 5. Conclusions

It'll be interesting to look at performance, but we should hit each with a bit of traffic and see how they fare, too.

## 6. More to Come

Let me know what static hosting you'd like to see added. I'll be sure to revisit this when I build the site out more and we'll see how this evolves.
