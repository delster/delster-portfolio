# WordPress vs Static Sites

In this post, I'm going to compare WordPress to SSGs and the static sites they generate. We'll cover how each handles different, vital components of a website, and compare them apples to apples.

## WordPress

WordPress is everywhere, right? It powers something like 30% of the web, and it completely dominates the CMS market. People in the WordPress place continue to tout how easy it is to use, but if you don't come from a WordPress background, I invite you to now take a break from reading (I know, we just got started!) and attempt to spin up a local WordPress dev environment, make some changes, then deploy it somewhere. Back yet? How long did it take you?

### WordPress Pros

### WordPress Cons

## Static Sites

### Static Sites Pros

* Speed
* Security
* Price
* Deployment

### Static Sites Cons

* Popularity
* Serverless Architecture
* Not Marketed to "Everyone"

## Conclusions

So what should you use for your site? It depends on your use case, obviously.
