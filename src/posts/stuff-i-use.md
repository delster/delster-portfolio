## HTML

Obviously, I use a lot of [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). I think the future is some combination of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)-style rich text editing with inline components, and some kind of concise HTML templating engine like [Pug (Jade)](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html). If you've seen or built something like that, I'd love to see it.
