## HTML

Obviously, I use a lot of [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). I think the future is some combination of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)-style rich text editing with inline components, and some kind of concise HTML templating engine like [Pug (Jade)](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html). If you've seen or built something like that, I'd love to see it.

## CSS

These days, I've been using a lot of `styled-components`, simply because it's popular. I think `Sass` + `CSS Modules` is a good compromise of component-scoped styling while still retaining (enhanced) CSS-like syntax, separation of concerns, autoprefixing and browser compatibility, etc. Everything you get from CSS-in-JS, just in another file specifically catered to styling. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
