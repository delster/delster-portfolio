## What This Repo Is

This is the code base for my personal website. I'll try to keep this `README` updated, but it's probably best to just visit the site this repo generates [here](https://davidelster.me/).

## ðŸš€ How to Use

This site is FOSS, it's built on FOSS, and everything I've personally written here is available to steal/modify/sell/whatever. This repo is **not** designed to be forked and directly built with, but I won't judge if you do. Feel free to learn from this repo, that's what I'm using it for!

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
